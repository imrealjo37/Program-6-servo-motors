# Program-6-servo-motors
This program controls 6 servo motors to perform two actions: first, the motors execute a sweeping motion 🤖↔️ (moving back and forth from 0° to 180°) for 2 seconds ⏱️, mimicking a smooth oscillation. After completing the sweep, all servos stop and hold their position at 90°, providing a stable and consistent final posture. 🎯✨
